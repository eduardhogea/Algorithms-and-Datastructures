# Algorithms-and-Datastructures
Some algorithms, mainly to exercise coding in Python
Most of them are working but the later ones need lots of improving.


Including:
Monte Carlo Integration, Linear Feedback Shift Register, AVL tree, Hashing(Chaining, Double Hashing), Graphs(Edge list and adjacency matrix + DFS transversal) and even more Graphs(Readmap system with Dijkstra).
